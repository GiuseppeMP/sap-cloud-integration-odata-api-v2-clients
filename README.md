<h1 align="center">Welcome to SAP Cloud Integration OData API Clients üëã</h1>

## TL;DR

To consume the SAP Cloud Integration APIs, you must install the SAP Cloud SDK and utilize the generated clients. It is necessary to properly configure tsconfig when using Typescript, which can be challenging as it may not always be compatible with your project.

Additionally, these files begin to appear in every project, leading to unnecessary boilerplate in many repositories within SAP projects.

Now you can simply run `npm install ts-sap-cloud-odata-api-v2-client` and start using the generated clients immediately without any stress.

## Features

Clients were generated for the following APIs in [Cloud Integration](https://api.sap.com/package/CloudIntegrationAPI/odata):


| Name | Version | Generated |
| ---- | ---- | --------- |
| [IntegrationContent](https://api.sap.com/api/IntegrationContent/resource/Integration_Package_Discover) | 1.0.0 | Yes |
| [LogFiles](https://api.sap.com/api/LogFiles/resource/Log_Files) | 1.0.0 | Yes |
| [MessageProcessingLogs](https://api.sap.com/api/MessageProcessingLogs/resource/Logs) | 1.0.0 | Yes |
| [MessageStore](https://api.sap.com/api/MessageStore/resource/Entries) | 1.0.0 | Yes |
| [PartnerDirectory](https://api.sap.com/api/PartnerDirectory/resource/Alternative_Partners) | 1.0.0 | Yes |
| [SecurityContent](https://api.sap.com/api/SecurityContent/resource/Certificate) | 1.0.0 | Yes |


## Install

```sh
npm i ts-sap-cloud-odata-api-v2-client
```

## Dependencies
```sh
npm i @sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity #required
npm i @sap-cloud-sdk/odata-v2 #optional
```

## Usage

Now you can simply use the generated clients in your code. The entire interface was kept from the SDK, and you can refer to the [documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/getting-started) to learn more.

[How to execute a request](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/features/odata/execute-request)


Each client is isolated in a module that can be imported using `'ts-sap-cloud-odata-api-v2-client/{APINAME}'`.
This is necessary to avoid conflicts with other modules as they are all generated separately.

*Example**

```js
import { registerDestination } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity'
import { messageProcessingLogs, MessageProcessingLogsType } from "ts-sap-cloud-odata-api-v2-client/MessageProcessingLogsClient";

async function example(name: string, url: string) {

    await registerDestination(
        {
            name: name, // choose name
            url: url // add url to your tenant
        },
    );

    const basePath = "/api/v1" // change if needed
    
    const requestBuilder = messageProcessingLogs<MessageProcessingLogsType>().messageProcessingLogsApi.requestBuilder().getAll()

    const getAll = requestBuilder.setBasePath(basePath).addCustomHeaders({ 'authorization': `Bearer ...` })

    return getAll.execute({ destinationName: name })
}
```
